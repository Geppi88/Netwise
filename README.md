🥚 Nestwise – Smarter Spending, Brighter Future
Nestwise is a modern, user-friendly web app designed to help people make more informed financial decisions when considering a purchase. By comparing the true cost of buying (with or without financing) to the potential growth of saving or investing that money, Nestwise empowers users to see the “opportunity cost” of their spending in a clear, visual way.

🌟 What Does Nestwise Do?
<br>
Compare Purchases vs. Savings:
Enter a product price and instantly see how much you could have if you invested that money instead, at a fixed 6% APY.
<br>
Financing Insights:
Toggle on financing to enter loan details (term and APR). Nestwise calculates your monthly payment, total loan cost, and total interest paid.
<br>
True Opportunity Cost:
If you finance, Nestwise uses the total amount you’ll pay over the life of the loan (including interest) as the amount you could have invested—showing the real cost of borrowing.
<br>
Savings Projections:
See how your money could grow over 1, 5, 10, and 30 years, with a beautiful chart to visualize your potential nest egg.
<br>
Delightful, Responsive UI:
Enjoy a clean, mobile-friendly interface with playful branding and a welcoming vibe.
